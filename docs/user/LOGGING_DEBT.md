# Logging Technical Debt & Production Safety

## 🎯 Overview
Audit revealed that several core components are using direct `console.log` calls instead of the centralized `logger.ts` utility. In production, these logs are not suppressed, which violates project security policies and potentially exposes sensitive internal flow information to users via browser console.

## 📝 Pending Tasks

### 1. Extension Service Worker & Modules
- **File:** `apps/extension/src/background/modules/authManager.ts`
  - [ ] Replace `console.log` on line 67 with `logger.info`.
  - [ ] Review other modules for non-logger logging.

### 2. Main World Bridge Scripts
- **File:** `apps/extension/src/content/inject-gemini-main.js`
  - [ ] Add a local `DEBUG_MODE` check or integrate with `logger` (requires careful bridge implementation).
  - [ ] Suppress lines 7, 32, 35, 56 in production builds.

### 3. General "console.*" Purge
- [ ] Scan `apps/extension/src` for any remaining `console.log`, `console.warn`, or `console.debug`.
- [ ] Ensure all logging goes through `@/lib/logger` to respect `isDebugMode()`.

### 4. Injection Safety
- [ ] Implement a way to pass the `VITE_DEBUG` or `DEV` flag into injected content scripts so they can conditionally disable their own logging.
