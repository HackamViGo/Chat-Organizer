# Privacy Policy for BrainBox Extension

**Last Updated:** December 17, 2024

## 1. Introduction
BrainBox ("we", "us", or "our") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our browser extension collects, uses, and protects your information.

## 2. Information We Collect

### A. Authentication Data
We collect and locally store authentication tokens (e.g., sessions, API tokens) for ChatGPT, Claude, and Google Gemini solely to enable the "Save" functionality. These tokens are stored securely in your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) and are **never** transmitted to our servers or any third parties.

### B. Conversation Data
When you explicitly click "Save" on a conversation, the extension fetches the text content and metadata of that specific conversation. This data is transmitted **directly** to your personal BrainBox Dashboard instance. We do not have access to this data.

## 3. How We Use Your Information
- **To specific functionality**: To fetch and save the conversations you select.
- **To maintain session state**: To keep you logged in to the supported platforms.

## 4. Data Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties. Your data exists only between your browser and your BrainBox Dashboard.

## 5. Security
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information:
- All data transmission occurs over secure HTTPS connections.
- Sensitive tokens are stored locally and are not accessible to other websites.

## 6. Your Consent
By using our extension, you consent to our privacy policy.

## 7. Changes to our Privacy Policy
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page.
